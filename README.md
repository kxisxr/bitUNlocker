# bitUNlocker
This script is based on the dislocker program, which allows us to decrypt and mount Bitlocker encrypted disks on Linux systems, it is recommended to use this script when we have many disks and we want to automate this process.

It installs automatically in debian and Mac OS but you can install it in other distributions by editing the package management program on this line:

[*] sudo apt-get install dislocker -y > /dev/null 2>&1
